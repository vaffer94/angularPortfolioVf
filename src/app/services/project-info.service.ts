Through the system, they can search for other players to play with and explore new games. Game creators can create new games from scratch or modify already existing ones. For example, a user can create his own version of an existing game, changing some rules or modifying the design of cards. In the system are included some statistics and surveys (for example: how many people played a particular game, how long the match was, the average time taken per turn). These statistics are useful for game creators to test the game, but also for players in choosing a game to play.",

      about: "InSignum is an interactive system to assist deaf people in their daily life at home. It consists of a smartwatch application and connected directional lights around the house, warning the user of the nature and the location of sounds at home. When something noisy is happening in the house, the smartwatch starts to vibrate, and the app displays what is happening. At the same time, the directional lights turn on guiding the user to the correct location of the sound. The color of the lights indicates the seriousness of the cause of the noise. The combination of the smartwatch app and the directional lights is to don't force users to always have the smartwatch and to have a backup system in case one of the two is not working properly. We tested the system by building a doll-house prototype with Arduino and emulating a smartwatch with Android Studio.",

      about: "PopUpBreak is a well-being desktop app with an emotional Virtual Coach (VC) that helps users in maintaining good practices for sedentary workers, as well as teaching new ones and keeping track of them. The VC can be customized by the user and, through a pop-up notification on the computer screen, it reminds them to do a pause, eye breaks, drink water, and others. Moreover, the application gives also some recommendations (e.g. how often a person should relax the eyes while working in front of a PC) and summarizes the activities done day by day. We believe that this system encourages people to work more healthily, avoiding the main consequences of a sedentary lifestyle. We use virtual coaching to reinforce users' behaviour, leading to acquiring good habits. ",

The prototype recognizes 3D objects and shows all the attached digital media (like old photos, videos, or annotations) as floating bubbles around the item. Then, the user can retrieve the memories or save new ones. We aim to amplify users' nostalgic feelings when they look at their past memories situated in their special object, as well as make them aware of the story of that object. ",

We overcome the limitations of the existing approaches proposing a VR game in which the player takes an active role in improving the learning models of the agents. The study explores how a game interaction in an immersive environment can improve the user experience in performing this interactive task, sharing the same space with the learning agents. ",
